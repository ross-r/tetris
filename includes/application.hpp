// Might be a good idea to contain all instances of Window objects
// inside of the Application class, that way I can track when a window is open or closed
// and prevent closing the application until window related resources have been properly
// cleaned up, as it stands, the deconstructor for the window class will be invoked
// upon application exit and thus any allocations and such can be handled independently of
// the Application class.
//
// I'm not entirely sure on which concept is the more prefered design paradigm.
//
// If we tracked each window locally we can hash the window name and use a hash map
// and that way we can grab the window via a routine, something like:
//    win = app.find_window( name )
//    win.call_something()
//    ...
//
// Maybe the above is better.
